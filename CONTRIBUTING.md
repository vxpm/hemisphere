# Contribution Guidelines

Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to `lazuli`!

In order to contribute, all you need to do is open a pull request. Before doing that, I ask that you
first open an issue if your change is beyond a few lines of code, so that the changes can be discussed
beforehand. This reduces the risk of wasted work.

# Pull Requests

Please describe the intent of your pull request in detail and link to any related issues. If your pull
request increases compatibility with a specific game, please mention it.

# Usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Do not** submit largely AI generated content (code, docs, whatever). It's fine to use AI as an _assistant_,
but **please** do not open pull requests with a high percentage of AI generated content.

As a rule of thumb, if you wrote the code and only used AI as a sort of turbo-autocomplete or as a research
tool, that's _probably_ fine. In general, **aim for minimum AI usage**.

# Licensing

When contributing, you acknowledge that your contributions are subject to the licensing of the crate
you modified.
